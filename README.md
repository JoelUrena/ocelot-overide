# Ocelot Overide
 This little mini game was made to replicate the id Tech Eninge that was used to make 3d 90's classics like Doom, Wolfenstein, and Duke Nukem 3D.

## Known bugs:
- Game speed doubles when monitors frame rate is higher than 60hz only on the windows executable file. For now, make sure the monitor is set to 60hz. 
- On the web player, playing it on windowed mode, ui is slightly missplaced. For now, play in fullscreen mode.
